### Hi there!
#### I'm a second year engineering student with a passion for open source and web development. I'm currently learning react and other exciting technologies to enhance my skillset. In my free time, you can find me tinkering with new projects or collaborating with others on exciting open source initiatives. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a developer. Feel free to check out my GitHub profile to see what I'm currently working on and to get in touch.
